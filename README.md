# ProjetoGuardaChuva
automation with python, sending morning message whether to bring an umbrella or not.

if you want to run the project create an account at https://openweathermap.org/ the api used to collect the data is One call 2.5 but version 3.0 already exists.

a telegram bot was also used to send the daily message https://medium.com/@ManHay_Hong/how-to-create-a-telegram-bot-and-send-messages-with-python-4cf314d9fa3e

my personal project is running on https://www.pythonanywhere.com/ so if you want the project to work 24 hours a day I recommend creating an account and playing the code there

instead of a telegram bot, you can change the function inside the telegram_bot_send_text to run with the twilio SMS API, but this may require the purchase of a twilio number
